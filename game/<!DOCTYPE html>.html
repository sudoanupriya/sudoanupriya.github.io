    <h1>Jeopardy Game Instructions</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the Jeopardy game! Here are the instructions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Divide the players into two teams and choose a moderator to share their screen and present the game board.</li>
      <li>The game board will contain categories and point values for each question. Each team takes turns in choosing a category and point value.</li>
      <li>The moderator reads the corresponding question and the team has 30 seconds to discuss and submit their answer in the chat.</li>
      <li>If the team answers correctly, they earn the points for that question. If they answer incorrectly, the other team gets a chance to steal the points by providing the correct answer in the chat.</li>
      <li>The moderator will reveal the correct answer and award points accordingly.</li>
      <li>The other team takes a turn to choose a category and point value, and the game continues in this way until the designated time limit has elapsed.</li>
      <li>At the end of the game, the team with the most points is declared the winner.</li>
    </ol>
